    <p>Machine Learning is my domain of expertise, but all kinds of computer science related topics draw my attention from time to time. Pushing machines to do new things is challening enough to keep me in constant development while it is powerfull enough to make meaningfull changes in our lives. This is what drives me to work hard every day.</p>
